# Complicated
Complicated is a utility for Apple Watch developers.

There's almost no way to say it without making a bad pun... Apple Watch complications are complicated. The programmatic documentation is fairly complete, but creating artwork that works well with various faces and tint modes is a bit of a puzzle, as is identifying which complication family is used on each face.

I created Complicated as a way to understand and experiment with complications. Each complication family displays unique initials, to clarify which is in use.

Complicated's image source Sketch document, which serves as further documentation of sizing and styling, is available within the app.

New watch releases often create new difficulties, with incorrect Xcode templates and documentation. Complicated demonstrates a naming and storage convention that works around outdated templates.
