Apple Watch complications are complicated.\n\n  The programmatic documentation is fairly complete, but creating artwork that works well with various faces and tint modes is a bit of a puzzle, as is identifying which complication family is used on each face.\n\n  I created Complicated as a way to understand and experiment with complications. Each complication family displays unique initials, to clarify which is in use.\n\n  Complicated is open source, as is the image source Sketch document, which serves as further documentation of sizing and styling.")
